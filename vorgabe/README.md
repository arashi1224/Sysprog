## Lock-free Ringbuffer

This is a thread-safe implementation of the lock-free ringbuffer introduced by the following guide: https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/lock-free-ring-buffer/.

## Compilation

Use the make command to compile the project. The executable(s) will be placed in the build directory.
For the daemon, you can use the 'rndtxt.txt' files, and comprare them against the 'rndtxt_lsg.txt' files in the 'test' directory, to see if the daemon works correctly.
